## Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset has 15 variables: origin(weather station)/EWR, year/2013,
month/1, day/1-15, hour(recorded time)/0-23, temp/temperature in F,
dewp/dew point in F, humidity/0-100, wind_dir/wind direction in degrees
0-360, wind_speed/wind speed in mph, precip/precipitation in inches,
pressure/sea level pressure in millibars, visib/visibility in miles, and
time_hour/recorded date and hour. The dataset has 358 rows and 15
columns. The mean temperature is 39.5821229F.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

``` r

```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

In this plot, the temperature increased as the day went on. On days with
high humidity, the temperature does not change much.

## Problem 2

``` r
P2_df = 
  tibble(
    ran_sam = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = ran_sam > 0,
    cha_vec = as.character(c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j")),
    fac_vec = factor(c("L1","L2","L3","L1","L2","L3","L1","L2","L3","L1"),
                     levels = c("L1","L2","L3"))
    )
```

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=1))
```

    ## [1] -0.2895441

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=2))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(P2_df, var = 3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(P2_df, var = 4)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The first and second column can take the mean, which are numeric and
logical columns. The last two column cannot take the mean, character and
factor cannot take the mean.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(P2_df,var=2))
as.numeric(pull(P2_df,var=3))
as.numeric(pull(P2_df,var=4))
```

Logical vector can be converted to numeric values, 1 for true and 0 for
false, so the logical vector has a mean.Character vector cannot be
converted to numbers.Letters in a character vector do not have numerical
meanings, so there are no numbers to represent these characters, and no
mean.The numerical values of the factor vector show the levels from 1 to
3. There is no mean for the level values because it is meaningless.
